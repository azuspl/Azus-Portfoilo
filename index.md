### Hello!

My name is Patrycjusz, I'm passionate about .Net, Photoshop, FL Studio and I'm coding in GLua for 7 years now, meanwhile I also had a break from gmod during which I did a lot of cool things in C# (mostly in FiveM, but also some applications in Xamarin). Since 2015, I've been hosting servers for most popular youtubers in Poland. For 2 years, I've been owner of my garry`s mod servers network.

#  My Projects:

# C# Destruction Derby FiveM GameMode

This gamemode was based on DD gamemode from MTA. This gamemode has nitro, repair pickups, custom maps, round systems, randomize cars and their types. To win, player must destruct other players cars or push them to the water.

# LUA SCP Breach 3.2 Garry's Mod 2017 - 2021

My biggest project while working with Garry’s Mod, spent 5 years on creating my version of Breach Gamemode. This includes built-in Cutscenes, new mechanics, abilities for SCP’s and classes, main menu with SFM animations, players animations and even more hidden features.

One in-game cutscene which is 30 seconds took me 1 month to script in Lua (I hate do something like In-Game Cutscenes in Lua. Awfully painful to do, but looks really cool on the final result), add sounds (for this big boss scene I've used over 80 sounds), particles etc.. Majority of players were concerned if that still was Garry's Mod.

### tip: white glowing hud icons = screens from new version of this gamemode

# LUA XFace: Random Face, Scale and Color 2019

I always wanted for some gamemodes like Murder to have random scale, color and face pose so for that I created this addon, useable on sandbox too

# LUA/C# StrefaGier DEV 2014 - 2020

I started developing for StrefaGier in 2014 and ended in 2020. StrefaGier was one of the biggest Polish communities in years 2015-2019, this is also where I've got to know YouTubers with over 800k - 1,85M subs and they in return started promoting our community. I'am the person who hosted all of their Garry's Mod servers when they needed them for their videos. Simultaneously hosted multiple community servers on gamemodes like: DeathRun, JailBreak, Murder, TTT extended, my gamemodes, Prop-Hunt, Hide n Seek and more, more other gamemodes

# LUA/C# NexusProject Owner/DEV 2020 - 2021

In 2020 I wanted to create something even bigger, I've wanted to create community where players could get to know each other and bond with one another for years like I did a long time ago, that's why I created NexusProject. I maintain in contact with Polish Youtubers like: Bladii, Mandzio, Chucken, Admiros, Plaga and we are all waiting for the premiere of s&box where they can promote this game in Poland like they did it in 2016-2018 when I hosted them servers for videos.

We are now expanding the NexusProject network with people working in modeling, C#, SFM animations. With these people we can do something more than normal gamemode.
